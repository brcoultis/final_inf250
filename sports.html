                This week our sports editor called in sick, so we've brought in a guest reporter (actually a homeless dude off the street).  In old news, the Kansas City Chiefs won the superbowl, it was an
                amazing comeback.

                This season, we're all looking forward to see if games will be open.  With the uncertainly surrounding the plague it is currently unknown what the upcoming season will look like.  Many speculate that
                the Chiefs are planning on announcing a new requirement for everyone to wear medieval plague masks to attend games.  Check back soon as this is a developing story.  
                For more information, visit the Chiefs homepage <a href="https://www.chiefs.com/" target="_blank">here.</a>
