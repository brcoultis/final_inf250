                In the latest news this month, the COVID-19 pandemic remains the top selling story of the month, news networks have wall to wall coverage of it, so we might as well throw a bit more onto the fire.
                First off as a disclaimer, we don't really know anything and are just going to repeat what everyone else is saying, just switching a few words around so you don't realize it.  Without further ado,
                here is the latest news.

                More governments continue to lock down, more statistics are revealed which make the truth that we are all doomed to die horrible deaths, or if we survive we'll probably get mesothelioma
                (except all the lawyers promising to get you money are dead).  This week on our proprietary AI tracking software we have inconclusive case numbers, the same as last week.
